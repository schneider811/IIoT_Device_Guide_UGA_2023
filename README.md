To go through this Guide I would recommend starting and trying the startup program. You will need a raspberry pi, an LED, a 330 ohm resistor and a breadboard. The other steps are discribed in the readme within that folder.

Once you have tried the startup folder you can try to build an executable file by running the workflow executable.yml and downloading that file and copying it over to your raspberry pi and seeing if it runs. 

Finally I would try to run the all_together.yml workflow, download that image and run it connecting your raspberry pi to thingsboard. 

There is a more detailed readme of changes required for each program to work in their respective folders.
